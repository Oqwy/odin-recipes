    <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle kosher salt over eggplant slices. Let excess moisture drain from eggplant, 10 to 15 
            minutes. Pat dry with paper towels and transfer to baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with black pepper.</li>
        <li>Combine spinach, onion, and garlic in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until 
            spinach is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>Mix Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and ricotta cheese together in a bowl. Stir in spinach mixture until well-combined.</li>
        <li>Spread 2 spoonfuls of spinach mixture evenly over each eggplant slice. Roll up eggplant.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/4 cup marinara sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange eggplant rolls 
            seam-side down in the dish. Pour remaining marinara sauce over rolls. Cover with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden, about 1 hour. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.</li>
