This is my first Odin Project. It's on creating a recipes website using HTML. I'll come back later to beautify this website using CSS when I've learnt more about it.

At the end of this project, I'll have showcased my skills in writing the basic (important) HTML commands that I'll get to encounter frequently during my career as a software developer.
